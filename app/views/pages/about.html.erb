  On February 10th, some of the best South Asian DJs are coming together to play their music for #brownkids all around America.
</p>
<h3>Sponsors</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Bid on a DJ</strong>
    <p>You can be as funny or serious as you like with your bids. You can submit as many <i>different</i> bids as you want. Think of it like a game of Apples to Apples. DJs will pick their favorite bids. You can offer them shoutouts, Facebook likes, or gulab jamuns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Get votes on your bids</strong>
    <p>You can get anyone to vote on your bids without creating an account. We restrict votes by IP so the same person can't sit their and vote all day though.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Every time a sponsor submits a bid or someone votes on a bid, <%= link_to "@collegedesis", "//twitter.com/collegedesis" %> will tweet about it. The goal is to get as many people to come to #TheBestBrownParty as possible. The more involved you get, the more involved the DJs will get and the more publicity your event gets.
