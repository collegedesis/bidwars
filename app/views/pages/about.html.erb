    On February 10th, some of the best South Asian DJs are coming together to play their music for #brownkids all around America.
    <ol>

      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Sponsors</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Bid on a DJ</strong>
      <p>You can be as funny or serious as you like with your bids. You can submit as many <i>different</i> bids as you want. Think of it like a game of Apples to Apples. DJs will pick their favorite bids. You can offer them shoutouts, Facebook likes, or gulab jamuns.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get votes on your bids</strong>
      <p>You can get anyone to vote on your bids without creating an account. We restrict votes by IP so the same person can't sit their and vote all day though.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Every time a sponsor submits a bid or someone votes on a bid, <%= link_to "@collegedesis", "//twitter.com/collegedesis", target: '_blank' %> will tweet about it. The goal is to get as many people to come to #TheBestBrownParty as possible. The more involved you get, the more involved the DJs will get and the more publicity your event gets.
